          <p>
            Ethiopian coffee holds a special place in the world as the origin of
            the coffee plant, Coffea arabica. The story dates back to the 9th
            century when, according to legend, a goat herder named Kaldi noticed
            his goats became lively and energetic after eating bright red coffee
            cherries. This discovery led to the early use of coffee in local
            communities, initially consumed as a simple drink made from crushed
            cherries mixed with animal fat.
          </p>
          <p>
            Over centuries, coffee consumption spread throughout Ethiopia and
            eventually reached the Arabian Peninsula, where it evolved into the
            brewed coffee familiar worldwide. Ethiopia remains the only country
            where coffee grows wild naturally, preserving its genetic diversity
            and rich history.
          </p>
          <h3>Coffee’s Role in Ethiopian Culture</h3>
          <p>
            Coffee is deeply embedded in Ethiopian culture, influencing social
            life, economy, and religious practices. It is not merely a drink but
            a symbol of hospitality and community bonding. Coffee farms also
            provide livelihoods for millions of Ethiopian farmers, making it a
            crucial agricultural product.
          </p>

        <section id="cultivation">
          <h2>Cultivation & Varieties</h2>
          <p>
            Ethiopia’s unique geography and climate create ideal conditions for
            growing coffee. The coffee plants thrive in high-altitude regions,
            typically between 1,500 and 2,200 meters above sea level, with ample
            rainfall and fertile volcanic soil.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are many indigenous coffee varieties in Ethiopia, known as
            heirloom varieties. These include famous types like Sidamo,
            Yirgacheffe, and Harrar, each offering distinct flavors ranging from
            fruity and floral to earthy and spicy.
          </p>
          <h3>Smallholder Farms & Sustainable Practices</h3>
          <p>
            Most Ethiopian coffee is cultivated by smallholder farmers who rely
            on traditional farming methods passed down through generations.
            Shade-grown coffee is common, which supports biodiversity by
            preserving forest cover. These sustainable farming practices help
            maintain soil health and reduce environmental impact.

          <h2>Processing Methods</h2>

          <p>
            Ethiopian coffee is processed primarily through two traditional
            methods: natural (dry) and washed (wet) processing.
          </p>
          <h3>Natural Processing</h3>
          <p>
            In the natural method, ripe coffee cherries are spread out on large
            drying beds under the sun. This process can take several days,
            during which the cherries are regularly turned to prevent spoilage.
            The dried cherries are then hulled to remove the outer layers,
            leaving the coffee bean inside.
          </p>
          <p>
            Natural processed coffee tends to have a fruity, wine-like flavor
            with a heavier body, highlighting the origin’s unique
            characteristics.
          </p>
          <h3>Washed Processing</h3>
          <p>
            Washed or wet processing involves removing the cherry flesh
            immediately after harvesting by soaking the cherries in water and
            using mechanical equipment to separate the beans. The beans are then
            fermented to remove mucilage and washed again before drying.
          </p>
          <p>
            This method produces cleaner, brighter flavors with floral and
            citrus notes, preferred by many specialty coffee lovers.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Ethiopian coffee ceremony is an integral social ritual that
            reflects the cultural importance of coffee. It is a communal event
            where friends, family, and neighbors gather to enjoy freshly brewed
            coffee together.
          </p>
          <h3>Steps of the Ceremony</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>Roasting:</strong> Green coffee beans are roasted over an
              open flame until they become dark and aromatic.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Grinding:</strong> The roasted beans are ground by hand
              using a mortar and pestle.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Brewing:</strong> The ground coffee is brewed in a
              traditional clay pot called a <em>jebena</em> over low heat.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Serving:</strong> The brewed coffee is poured into small
              handle-less cups called <em>cini</em>, often served with sugar or
              salt depending on regional preferences.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            The ceremony can last up to an hour and is often accompanied by
            conversation, storytelling, and the sharing of traditional snacks
            like popcorn or roasted barley.
